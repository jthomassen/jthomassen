# Greetings, I'm Jeff Thomassen!

Junior Full Stack Developer with experience in React.js, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. Background in music composition, audio engineering and customer service with impeccable organizational skills and a big heart :heartpulse:

Driven to solve problems creatively & efficiently, while having loads of fun doing it. Three words that old bosses and friends would use to describe me are empathetic, talented, and passionate. 

My hot take is that programming fires dopamine to the same neurons as audio production :notes:
